# SurfaceAnisotropyCalculator
Class to deal with a mesh and calculations on it.
The project is in a very rudimentary state. The intended scope of the project is to allow for easy calculations of (relevant) Minkowski tensors, as described in Schr√∂der-Turk _et al_. "Tensors of Anisotropic Spatial Structure" New J. Phys. 2013, https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/15/8/083028.

## Changelog

0.1.0
The whole internal structure is changed to allow for more complex calculations. The class now uses Pandas dataframes.
The minkowski scalars W1 and W3 can now be calculated.
The `MeshCalculator.cropmesh()` method now actually cleans up verteces that are outside the specified region and removes verteces which are not part of any faces.
